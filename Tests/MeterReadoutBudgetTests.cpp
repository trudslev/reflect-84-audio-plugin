/**
    The IN/OUT readout's character budget.

    **Suite ruling 2026-08-14: floor sentinel, +99.9 ceiling, one decimal always, no plus at exactly
    0.0 dB.** The widest string is then FIVE as a GUARANTEE rather than as a range, and that
    distinction is the point: the question a well's width has to answer is not what the readout has
    been observed to print but what it can ever be ASKED to print. An observed idle string is the
    same class of evidence as an uncrashing over-delivery.

    **No readout in ANY of the six castings had a ceiling** — the widest string was bounded only by
    how loud the signal got. Gatecrasher is the evidence nobody considered the numerals needed one:
    it carries a meter ceiling constant that feeds its BAR while its readout ignored it. Reusing that
    constant would have been wrong in the other direction, clamping a genuine +6 dB reading to "0.0",
    so the readout has its own.

    **And the sign at exactly 0.0 dB was one value with two answers.** Chorus-60 printed the plus at
    `db >= 0.0f` and Gatecrasher at `db > 0.0f`, so at exactly unity one read "+0.0" and the other
    "0.0" — no reason behind either, just whichever comparison somebody typed. The plus means ABOVE
    unity, and 0.0 dB is not.
